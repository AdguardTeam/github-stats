However, with Opera GX it happens every time when the AdGuard extension is active, for Opera GX, there's only one way to fix it, which is to stop the AdGuard extension, even with AdGuard Allowlist it doesn't provide any way out.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

나무위키의 파워링크 및 기타 광고 차단을 위한 지침\r\n\r\n최근 나무위키에서 지속적인 파워링크 필터 대응에 따라 많은 광고 차단기 필터들이 재대응을 목표로 하고 있습니다.\r\n빠른 대응 속도에 광고 차단기의 필터 업데이트 속도가 따라가지 못해 현재 많은 수의 오차단이 발생하고 있습니다.\r\n\r\n즉, 저희가 필터를 업데이트하여도 실제로 여러분의 광고 차단기는 업데이트를 제때 받지 못할 수도 있다는 문제점이 있습니다.\r\n\r\n더욱 효과적인 차단을 위해 아래 사항을 권고드립니다.\r\n\r\n## 광고 차단기의 설정을 업데이트하여 필터 업데이트 속도 개선\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nAdGuard나 여타 광고 차단기에서의 빠른 필터 업데이트를 위해 기존 필터 목록에서 List-KR을 제외하고 사용자 지정 필터 목록에 List-KR을 신뢰된 필터로 추가하세요.\r\n\r\n### Windows, Android 및 웹 브라우저 확장 프로그램 (Safari 제외)\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/236#issue-1168415899\r\n\r\n### iOS 및 macOS의 AdGuard for Safari\r\n\r\n아래 글을 참고하여 추가로 필터 패치가 필요합니다.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/236#issuecomment-1084964861\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## 광고가 차단되지 않았을 때 / 잘못 차단되었을 때\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n나무위키의 차단은 현재 IP 대역 및 기타 환경에 따라 다르게 보일 수 있다고 추정하고 있습니다.\r\n광고가 정상적으로 차단되지 않은 경우에는 **로그인 여부** 및 **사용하시는 통신사** 등의 환경을 추가로 댓글에 기입해주시면 더 나은 대응이 가능합니다.\r\n또 차단되지 않은 페이지의 DOM 구조 또한 파악이 필요한데 사용하시는 웹 브라우저에서 우클릭 후 웹 사이트 저장을 통해 추가 정보를 업로드해주시면 감사하겠습니다.\r\n\r\n개인정보가 포함된 경우 Thunderbird 등의 메일 암호화 서비스를 통하여 아래의 지원 이메일 주소 중 하나로 암호화된 메일을 전송해주십시오.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/223\r\n\r\n> 그 외 타 광고 차단 필터를 사용하면 DOM 구조가 정상적으로 표지되지 않을 수 있으니 광고 차단기를 끄고 저장해주세요.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## 성능 문제의 발생\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n저희는 현재 이미 경우에 따라 성능 문제가 발생할 수 있음을 인지하고 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제는 광고 차단기의 나무위키의 DOM을 검사하는 과정에서 패턴을 인식하는데에 과도한 리소스가 사용되어 발생하는 것입니다.\r\n이는 장기적인 목표로 해결되어야 하지만 단기적으로 빠른 차단을 위해 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제로 인해 불편을 감수하시는 경우 현재 레포지토리의 최근 커밋 목록을 참조하여 필터 규칙을 따로 비활성화할 수 있도록 하십시오.\r\n\r\n규칙을 비활성화하려면 `namu.wiki#@#`로 시작하는 규칙을 사용자 규칙에 추가하면 됩니다.\r\n\r\n### 직접 광고를 차단하기\r\n\r\n이 때에는 직접 광고를 차단하실 수 있도록 사용하시는 광고 차단기에서 **직접 웹 사이트의 요소 차단** 기능을 이용하시는 것이 권장됩니다.\r\n\r\n> 단, 현재 방식으로 생성된 규칙을 저장소에 전송하지 마세요. 나무위키의 구조는 무작위로 변경되는 특성이 있어 다른 사람에게 적용되지 않거나 너무 많이 업데이트해야 할 수도 있습니다.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @seia-soto in

나무위키의 파워링크 및 기타 광고 차단을 위한 지침\r\n\r\n최근 나무위키에서 지속적인 파워링크 필터 대응에 따라 많은 광고 차단기 필터들이 재대응을 목표로 하고 있습니다.\r\n빠른 대응 속도에 광고 차단기의 필터 업데이트 속도가 따라가지 못해 현재 많은 수의 오차단이 발생하고 있습니다.\r\n\r\n즉, 저희가 필터를 업데이트하여도 실제로 여러분의 광고 차단기는 업데이트를 제때 받지 못할 수도 있다는 문제점이 있습니다.\r\n\r\n더욱 효과적인 차단을 위해 아래 사항을 권고드립니다.\r\n\r\n## 광고 차단기의 설정을 업데이트하여 필터 업데이트 속도 개선\r\n\r\n<details>\r\nAdGuard나 여타 광고 차단기에서의 빠른 필터 업데이트를 위해 기존 필터 목록에서 List-KR을 제외하고 사용자 지정 필터 목록에 List-KR을 신뢰된 필터로 추가하세요.\r\n\r\n### Windows, Android 및 웹 브라우저 확장 프로그램 (Safari 제외)\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/236#issue-1168415899\r\n\r\n### iOS 및 macOS의 AdGuard for Safari\r\n\r\n아래 글을 참고하여 추가로 필터 패치가 필요합니다.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/236#issuecomment-1084964861\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## 광고가 차단되지 않았을 때 / 잘못 차단되었을 때\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n나무위키의 차단은 현재 IP 대역 및 기타 환경에 따라 다르게 보일 수 있다고 추정하고 있습니다.\r\n광고가 정상적으로 차단되지 않은 경우에는 **로그인 여부** 및 **사용하시는 통신사** 등의 환경을 추가로 댓글에 기입해주시면 더 나은 대응이 가능합니다.\r\n또 차단되지 않은 페이지의 DOM 구조 또한 파악이 필요한데 사용하시는 웹 브라우저에서 우클릭 후 웹 사이트 저장을 통해 추가 정보를 업로드해주시면 감사하겠습니다.\r\n\r\n개인정보가 포함된 경우 Thunderbird 등의 메일 암호화 서비스를 통하여 아래의 지원 이메일 주소 중 하나로 암호화된 메일을 전송해주십시오.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/issues/223\r\n\r\n> 그 외 타 광고 차단 필터를 사용하면 DOM 구조가 정상적으로 표지되지 않을 수 있으니 광고 차단기를 끄고 저장해주세요.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## 성능 문제의 발생\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n저희는 현재 이미 경우에 따라 성능 문제가 발생할 수 있음을 인지하고 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제는 광고 차단기의 나무위키의 DOM을 검사하는 과정에서 패턴을 인식하는데에 과도한 리소스가 사용되어 발생하는 것입니다.\r\n이는 장기적인 목표로 해결되어야 하지만 단기적으로 빠른 차단을 위해 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\n성능 문제로 인해 불편을 감수하시는 경우 현재 레포지토리의 최근 커밋 목록을 참조하여 필터 규칙을 따로 비활성화할 수 있도록 하십시오.\r\n\r\n규칙을 비활성화하려면 `namu.wiki#@#`로 시작하는 규칙을 사용자 규칙에 추가하면 됩니다.\r\n\r\n### 직접 광고를 차단하기\r\n\r\n이 때에는 직접 광고를 차단하실 수 있도록 사용하시는 광고 차단기에서 **직접 웹 사이트의 요소 차단** 기능을 이용하시는 것이 권장됩니다.\r\n\r\n> 단, 현재 방식으로 생성된 규칙을 저장소에 전송하지 마세요. 나무위키의 구조는 무작위로 변경되는 특성이 있어 다른 사람에게 적용되지 않거나 너무 많이 업데이트해야 할 수도 있습니다.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @seia-soto in

(I.E., all each site has to do is generate another b-cdn subdomain & back to square 1). So, a real solution is badly needed.\r\n\r\nI always understood blocking as a cat and mouse game. With enough determination nothing can be effectively blocked. I can understand if one hopes to control the size of the block list but in this situation if there isn't a better way (I hope there is,) doing nothing about it will only encourage this sort of tracking.

Comment\r\n> На Яндекс Музыке во время проигрывания появляется окно \"Чтобы слушать музыку без остановки, оформите подписку\". Оформлять подписку я не хочу — это платно, а у меня вся семья на иждивении, и тратить деньги на то, что используется для забавы, будет эгоизмом. Это сообщение блокирует музыку, и это мне мешает. Само сообщение я убил при помощи AdBlock, но по окончании трека экран всё равно блокируется, и музыка замолкает, приходится включать вручную. Это очень неудобно, если я слушаю не один трек, а целый альбом, работая при этом на другой вкладке. Пожалуйста, уберите остатки этой рекламы.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

page.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1.

Comment\r\n> На Яндекс Музыке во время проигрывания появляется окно \"Чтобы слушать музыку без остановки, оформите подписку\". Оформлять подписку я не хочу — это платно, а у меня вся семья на иждивении, и тратить деньги на то, что используется для забавы, будет эгоизмом. Это сообщение блокирует музыку, и это мне мешает. Само сообщение я убил при помощи AdBlock, но по окончании трека экран всё равно блокируется, и музыка замолкает, приходится включать вручную. Это очень неудобно, если я слушаю не один трек, а целый альбом, работая при этом на другой вкладке.
